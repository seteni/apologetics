   <h5><b>Apologetics is a word that is often misunderstood, as if it means ‘apologising’ for one’s faith.
        The word, however, derives its meaning from the Greek apologia, meaning a ‘reasoned defence’.

    In the Bible, apologetics is synonymous with evangelism:

    But in your hearts, set apart Christ as Lord.
        Always be prepared to give an answer [apologia] to everyone who asks you for the reason for the hope that you have,
        but do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience

    1 Peter 3:15-16

    Today, the need for sound apologetics has arguably never been greater.
        Authors such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris continue to top the best seller lists and are already influencing a whole new generation of thinkers to reject God ‘out of hand’.

    We hope that at the Seteni Christian Apologetics, we are part of the answer.
           it is normal to have questions and we do our best to have your questions answered with bible reference</b>
